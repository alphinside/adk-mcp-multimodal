    PROMPT WRITING TIPS:
    Describe what you want to see in the video. Focus on:
    - Product actions/movements (e.g., "rotating slowly", "zooming into details")
    - Desired camera angles (e.g., "close-up of the product", "wide shot")
    - Background/environment (e.g., "minimalist white backdrop", "lifestyle setting")
    - Any specific details about the product presentation

    The system will automatically enhance your prompt with professional production quality.

    Args:
        prompt: Description of the video to generate. Focus on the core product presentation
                you want. The system will automatically add professional quality enhancements.
